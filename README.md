# Health Care Premium Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting health care insurance premiums using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to estimate premiums based on key features such as **age**, **smoking habits**, **BMI**, and **medical history**. 

### Key Features of the Project:
- **Machine Learning Models Used**:
  - Linear Regression
  - XGBoost Regressor  
- **Best Model**: The **XGBoost Regressor** was selected as the optimal model, achieving an impressive **97% accuracy** on the test dataset.  

### Error Analysis:
- Conducted detailed error analysis to evaluate the model's performance across different data segments.
- Observed that the model's predictions were consistently **positive and reliable**, aligning well with the actual premium values.

### Project Highlights:
- Comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering to handle various types of input data.
- Comparison of model performance to ensure accurate predictions.
- Clear and concise code structure to make it easy to understand and extend.  

### Technology Stack:
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

.  

### Potential Use Cases:
- Health insurance providers can use this model to estimate premiums more accurately based on client profiles.
- Enables data-driven decisions for personalized insurance plans.
